# Decoding Victory in League of Legends: A Comparative Study of Early Game Statistics

## Overview

This repository contains data and code used to produce a paper that analyzes League of Legends data from 2018-2023. We examine early game variables to analyze their correlation to the likelihood of winning a game.

## Abstract
Esports, especially League of Legends, have rapidly evolved into a major professional sports phenomenon, featuring international tournaments and attracting a massive global player base. This paper delves into the statistical analysis of League of Legends Worlds Championship data from 2018-2023, focusing on early game variables gold, expereince and creep score and their impact on the win probability. Results indicate that while generally higher early game statistics compared to the opposing team are associated with increased chances of victory, the findings suggest that paradoxically, lower statistics at the 10-minute mark enhance the likelihood of winning, highlighting the complexity of strategic gameplay in League of Legends.

## LLM Usage: 
Chat-gpt4 was used as our generative ai to help with definitions, error codes and exceptional cases in the code.
LLM usage is documented in inputs//LLM/usage.txt. 

## File Structure

The repo is structured as follows:

-   `inputs/data` contains the data sources used in analysis including the raw data. The data is downloaded from [https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1gLSw0RLjBbtaNy0dgnGQDAZOHIgCe-HH]
